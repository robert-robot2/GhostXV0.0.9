# GhostXV0.0.9

> **DirectX12 RHI Renderer · WinForms Shell · Blazor WASM UI**

A Windows desktop application that fuses a raw **DirectX 12 RHI rendering engine** with a **Blazor WebAssembly UI** hosted inside a WinForms shell via WebView2. The native DX12 renderer runs alongside the Blazor frontend, enabling real-time GPU-driven graphics controlled through a modern web-based interface — all in a single application.

---

## Features

- 🎮 **DirectX 12 RHI Renderer** — low-level GPU rendering pipeline with full DX12 control
- 🌐 **Blazor WASM UI** — browser-based UI layer hosted in-process via WebView2
- 🪟 **WinForms Shell** — native Windows host with dropdown menus and window management
- 🔗 **JS Interop Bridge** — communication between the Blazor frontend and the DX12 backend
- 📦 **Self-contained** — no external servers, everything runs locally

## Prerequisites

- Windows 10/11 (x64)
- [.NET 10.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- [Visual Studio 2022+](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) with:
  - ASP.NET and web development workload
  - Desktop development with C++ workload
- [WebView2 Runtime](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/)
- DirectX 12 compatible GPU

---

## Setup & Installation

Follow these steps to integrate the Blazor WASM UI into the WinForms DX12 shell:

### 1. Create Blazor App Inside the Solution

Add a new **Blazor WebAssembly** project to the existing Visual Studio solution alongside the WinForms project.

### 2. Add WebView2 to the WinForms Project

Install the WebView2 NuGet package in the `GhostShell` project:

```
Microsoft.Web.WebView2
```

### 3. Add GhostUIHost.cs to the WinForms Project

Add `GhostUIHost.cs` to `GhostShell` — this class manages WebView2 initialization and points it at the published Blazor output.

### 4. Update Program.cs (WinForms)

Configure the WinForms entry point to start the UI host before launching the application:

```csharp
internal static class Program
{
    [STAThread]
    static void Main()
    {
        GhostUIHost.Start();
        Application.EnableVisualStyles();
        Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(false);
        Application.Run(new GhostForm());
    }
}
```

### 5. Update GhostForm.cs

Wire up the WinForms main window to display the WebView2 control and handle layout alongside the DX12 render surface.

### 5A. Update GhostMenuBuilder.cs

Configure the dropdown menu builder to add menu items that communicate with the Blazor UI layer.

### 6. Update index.html in the Blazor Project

Update `wwwroot/index.html` in the Blazor project to configure the base href and ensure compatibility with WebView2 hosting.

### 6A. Check .csproj for Both Projects

Verify both project files are correctly configured:

- **GhostBlazorUI.csproj** — ensure `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly` references and target framework are set
- **GhostShell.csproj** — ensure WebView2 package reference is present

### 7. Publish the Blazor Project

```bash
dotnet publish GhostBlazorUI -c Debug
```

### 8. Copy Published Output to WinForms wwwroot

Copy the contents of the Blazor publish output to the WinForms debug bin folder:

```
GhostBlazorUI/bin/Debug/net10.0/publish/wwwroot/
        ↓
GhostShell/bin/Debug/net10.0/wwwroot/
```

### 9. Build and Run

Build the solution in Visual Studio and run `GhostShell`. The WinForms window will launch with the DX12 renderer active and the Blazor UI hosted via WebView2.

---

## Usage

- Launch the application from Visual Studio (`Debug → Start`) or the compiled executable
- Use the **File / Settings / Help** dropdown menus in the WinForms shell to interact with the application
- The **Blazor UI** panel provides the web-based interface layer
- The **DX12 renderer** runs in the background, rendering directly to the native window surface
